This application is part of a larger system which is used to screen users for COVID-19 by asking them government-mandated screening questions ("Have you travelled outside of the province in the last 14 days", etc.) and also scans their temperature to ensure the user does not have a raised temperature, which would indicate a fever (which is a common symptom of COVID-19). 

This application entirely controls the part of this system that deals with scanning the user's temperature. Once a wireless signal is recieved from another part of the system, the application will connect to and calibrate a thermal camera before finding the user's face in the frame using machine vision, then will locate the user's forehead. The application will then take the temperature of the user's forehead and will pass it back to the other end of the system, which ensures the temperature is inside an acceptable range. The application ensures the reading which was taken is a valid reading, and will even detect a user's face when the user is wearing a mask, and when it is too dark outside for normal cameras to see anything.

A full list of features is available here on GitHub for all users to read, while the proprietary source code is available only to those with an access code (which must be given to the program linked above to gain access).
